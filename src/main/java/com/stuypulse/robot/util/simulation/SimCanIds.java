/**
 * Utility for assigning unique CAN IDs to simulated Phoenix 6 devices.
 *
 * <p>On the real robot, devices may exist on multiple CAN buses (for example, the drivetrain on a
 * CANivore and the rest of the robot on the roboRIO CAN bus), allowing the same numerical CAN ID to
 * be reused across buses.
 *
 * <p>However, Phoenix 6 simulation currently exposes every simulated device on a single virtual CAN
 * bus, regardless of which CAN bus they are configured to use. This means IDs that are valid on the
 * real robot may collide in simulation, preventing devices from functioning correctly.
 *
 * <p>This class works around that limitation by:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Reserving the real CAN IDs used by the swerve modules (which rely on their configured IDs
 *       for Phoenix's drivetrain simulation).
 *   <li>Assigning unique, unused CAN IDs to every other simulated TalonFX on demand.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The assigned IDs exist solely for simulation and have no effect on the real robot. Calling
 * {@link #get(String)} on real hardware will throw an exception to prevent accidental misuse.
 *
 * <p>Every assignment is logged through DogLog under {@code Simulation/CAN Assignments/...}, making
 * it easy to determine which simulated device received each CAN ID.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because Phoenix 6 currently does not support simulating multiple independent
 * CAN buses:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 *
 * "Multiple CAN buses using the CANivore API is not supported at this time. All CAN devices will
 * appear on the same CAN bus. If you wish to run your robot code in simulation, ensure devices have
 * unique IDs across CAN buses."
 *
 * </blockquote>
